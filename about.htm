  Computational geometry is everywhere: 
  <ul>
    <li>Video games perform millions of
  geometric computations every second to keep track of the movement of
  game objects, determine collisions, and render the resulting scene.</li>
    <li>
  The GPS systems in our cars and cellphones use geometric shortest path
  algorithms to lead us from one place to another.</li>
    <li>Smartphones analyze the
  geometry of our touch gestures to control their interfaces.</li>
   <li> Computers
  in new automobiles use distance and speed calculations to warn of
  impending collisions.</li>
    <li>The majority of man-made objects are designed
  with geometric design (CAD) tools: everything from computer chips,
  measured in nanometers, to the largest buildings in the world, measured
  in millions of cubic meters.</li>
  </ul>
  It is hard to find a major industry
  that has not been significantly impacted by the ability of computers to
  perform geometric computations.

    The Computational Geometry Lab is located in 5170 Herzberg Building, within the <a href="http://www.scs.carleton.ca/">School of Computer Science</a>, at <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lab's [[students and faculty members|people.html]] do research in algorithms and data structrues with a particular focus on <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry">computational geometry</a></em>: the study of algorithms for geometric problems.</p>
